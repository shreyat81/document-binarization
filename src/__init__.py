Whale Optimization Algorithm for Document Binarization
=======================================================

This module implements Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) for optimizing
binarization thresholds to improve performance across different document types.

WOA is a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm that mimics the hunting
behavior of humpback whales.
